overview: >-
  Wolverine is the best there is at what he does--although of course, what he
  does isn’t very nice. But long before he was a member of the X-Men, a
  tormented experiment of the Weapon X project, or even a savage bar brawler
  known as Logan, he was simply a young boy.  What incredible forces created
  this man, the world’s greatest killing machine? For years, Wolverine has
  searched desperately for answers from his past, from the wilds of the Canadian
  wilderness to the teeming cities of Japan and beyond. And despite his
  perseverance and longing for the truth, he remains an enigma to himself and
  those around him. But, in this landmark event, Marvel reveals all: The birth
  and childhood of young James Howlett…the intriguing secrets of his family
  history…and the tragedy that changed everything.  Welcome to the greatest
  story never told.
