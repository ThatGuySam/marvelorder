  Spider-Man is an animated television series that ran from September 9, 1967 to
  June 14, 1970. It was jointly produced in Canada and the United States and was
  the first animated adaptation of the Spider-Man comic book series, created by
  writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko. It first aired on the ABC television
  network in the United States but went into syndication at the start of the
  third season. Grantray-Lawrence Animation produced the first season. Seasons 2
  and 3 were crafted by producer Ralph Bakshi in New York City. In Canada, it is
  currently airing on Teletoon Retro. An internet meme, commonly known as 1960s
  Spiderman, regarding the series has received an overwhelming amount of
  popularity. The meme consists of a screenshot taken at a random part of the
  series and adding an inappropriate and/or witty text. Since the death of Max
  Ferguson on March 7 2013, there are only three surviving members from the
  cast. Those three being Paul Soles the voice of Spider-Man, Chris Wiggins the
  voice of Mysterio and Carl Banas the voice of the Scorpion.
