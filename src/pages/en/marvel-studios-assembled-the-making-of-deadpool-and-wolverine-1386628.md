description: >-
  When it was announced that Deadpool was officially joining the MCU, some of us
  thought only one thing: Finally! The merc with the mouth is getting his very
  own episode of "Assembled!" And now dear friends, here it is, replete with
  excessive expletives and violence, just the way the Almighty intended. Oh, and
  don't get your tighty whities in a twist. We didn't forget about Wolverine.
  His ill-tempered majesty is fully in the mix. Yes, we've cajoled Hugh Jackman,
  Ryan Reynolds, and director Shawn Levy (plus a bunch of other folks you've
  undoubtedly never hear of, but are delightful nonetheless) to sit down and
  spill proverbial beans about how "Deadpool & Wolverine" was conceived, carried
  to term, and then birthed. In all honesty, Hugh, Ryan, and the rest are
  contractually obligated to divulge this information. They do a damn fine job
  of pretending like they really wanted to, like it was their idea or something.
  Enjoy!
