description: >-
  In the early 1990s, few beyond those who journeyed into the pages of Marvel
  comics had ever heard of “Rogue,” “Beast,” “Gambit,” or even “Wolverine.” But
  that sad state of affairs changed forever when “X-Men: The Animated Series"
  debuted on television and touched millions hungry for something different. The
  series was unlike any cartoon that had come before it, exploring themes of
  prejudice and social justice. The characters were super, but they were also
  outsiders, underdogs. Kids everywhere could relate – as well as adults.
  “Assembled” recalls the birth of “X-Men: The Animated Series” and its revival
  thirty years later as “X-Men ’97.” Spend time with the original cast members,
  along with new voices, as they reveal the stories behind the classic show and
  its uncompromising continuation.
