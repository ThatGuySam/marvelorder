  An artist, Steve Rogers, is nearly murdered by spies, looking for his late
  father's national secrets. He is saved during surgery when a secret formula is
  injected into him; this serum not only heals him but also gives him fantastic
  strength and lightning reflexes.  To help him solve the mystery behind his
  father’s murder and bring those guilty to justice, a government agency equips
  him with a special motorcycle loaded with gadgets and an indestructible
  shield. Now armed, he battles against the nation's enemies as the Sentinel of
  Liberty, Captain America.
