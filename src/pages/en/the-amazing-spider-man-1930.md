description: >-
  Peter Parker is an outcast high schooler abandoned by his parents as a boy,
  leaving him to be raised by his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Like most teenagers,
  Peter is trying to figure out who he is and how he got to be the person he is
  today. As Peter discovers a mysterious briefcase that belonged to his father,
  he begins a quest to understand his parents' disappearance – leading him
  directly to Oscorp and the lab of Dr. Curt Connors, his father's former
  partner. As Spider-Man is set on a collision course with Connors' alter ego,
  The Lizard, Peter will make life-altering choices to use his powers and shape
  his destiny to become a hero.
