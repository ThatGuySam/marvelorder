  The Incredible Hulk is an American animated television series starring the
  Marvel Comics character the Hulk. It ran two seasons, for 21 episodes, on the
  television network UPN from 1996 to 1997. Lou Ferrigno, who portrayed
  Universal's version of the Hulk on the 1970s live-action TV series, provided
  the Hulk's voice for the true version from Marvel.


  The show often featured cameo appearances by characters from other Marvel
  cartoons of the period. In the second season, the show's format, after UPN
  decided that Season 1 was too dark, was changed, and to give "female viewers a
  chance", the network ordered that She-Hulk be made a regular co-star. As a
  result, the series was officially renamed The Incredible Hulk and She-Hulk.
  The second season also featured the Grey Hulk.
