  Spider-Man: The New Animated Series is an American animated series based on
  the Marvel comic book superhero character Spider-Man, which ran for one
  season, 13 episodes, starting on July 11, 2003. It is a loose continuation of
  2002's Spider-Man film directed by Sam Raimi. The show was made using computer
  generated imagery rendered in cel shading and was broadcast on MTV, and YTV.
  Eight months later after the series finale, episodes aired in reruns on ABC
  Family as part of the Jetix television programming block. The series featured
  a far more mature version of the character than typically seen on television
  for any animated comic book adaptation. Throughout the series, characters are
  clearly killed, rather than the usual ambiguous disappearance, and several
  characters are strongly implied to have had sex.
