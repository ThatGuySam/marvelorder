  Mutant X is a science fiction television series that debuted on October 6,
  2001. The show was created by Avi Arad, and it centers around Mutant X, a team
  of "New Mutants" who possess extraordinary powers as a result of genetic
  engineering. The members of Mutant X were used as test subjects in a series of
  covert government experiments. The mission of Mutant X is to seek out and
  protect their fellow New Mutants. The series was filmed in Toronto, Ontario,
  Canada.


  Even though the series had high ratings and was meant to be renewed for a
  fourth season, it was abruptly canceled in 2004 after the dismantling of
  Fireworks Entertainment, one of the show's production companies, ending the
  show on a cliffhanger.
