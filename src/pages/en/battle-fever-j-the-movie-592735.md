description: >-
  Egos kidnaps the children of Information Supervisor Sakaguchi, Yoko and
  Kenichi. They then blackmail him into stealing the blueprints and completion
  status of the Battle Fever robo. Tetsuzan Shogun, who joined the Defense
  Department at the same time as Sakaguchi, is greatly concerned and confronts
  him. Sakaguchi escapes but vows to make amends. He appears at Egos factory,
  where they too are building a giant robo, and discloses a false timetable.
  When Egos orders them killed, Sakaguchi reveals dynamite strapped to his body.
  He backs away with his children and gets them to safety. He then returns to
  the factory, and blows himself up to destroy it. Unfortunately, his sacrifice
  is in vain, as their evil robo is already completed. But Battle Fever’s giant
  robo is also complete and ready to save the day!
