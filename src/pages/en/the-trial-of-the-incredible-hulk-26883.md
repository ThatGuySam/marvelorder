description: >-
  On the run again, Dr. David Banner is jailed for assault after interrupting a
  mugging. Blind attorney Matt Murdock enlists Banner's help in locating the
  muggers because he believes they work for his longtime foe, Fisk, the head of
  an international crime network. But David, afraid of public exposure, breaks
  out of jail as the Hulk. Tracking David down, Murdock reveals his own secret:
  His blindness came from a radioactive spill, and after developing his other
  senses so incredibly, he has become the amazingly athletic crime fighter
  called Daredevil. Fisk must now face off against Daredevil and the Incredible
  Hulk!
