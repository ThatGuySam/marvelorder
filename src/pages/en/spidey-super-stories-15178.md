description: >-
  A live-action, recurring skit on the PBS children's television series The
  Electric Company. Episodes featured the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man,
  provided to the Children's Television Workshop free of charge, and was played
  by puppeteer and dancer Danny Seagren.


  Stories involved the masked superhero foiling mischievous characters who were
  involved in petty criminal activities. The cast of The Electric Company played
  the roles of the various characters in each story, with another serving as
  narrator. In many of these sketches, viewers were addressed as "true
  believers."


  Unlike other live-action and cartoon productions of Spider-Man, this version
  of the web-slinging hero did not speak out loud, instead communicating only
  with word balloons, in order to encourage young viewers to practice their
  reading skills because he was drawn without a mouth. He also never appeared
  out of his costume as Peter Parker and, given the series' budget limitations,
  used his web-shooters sparingly.
