description: >-
  You are thousands of years old. You have amazing powers. You have watched
  civilizations rise and fall. So why does no one remember any of this?
  Best-selling author, Neil Gaiman (Marvel: 1602) is joined by superstar artist,
  John Romita. Jr. (Amazing Spider-Man), to bring you the extraordinary tale of
  The Eternals. Medical student Mark Curry's world is turned upside-down when he
  meets Ike Harris, a man who believes that he is part of a centuries-old race
  of super-powered beings put here on Earth by aliens to preserve and safeguard
  the planet — and even crazier, tried to convince Mark that he is one too.
