description: >-
  Before Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr took the names Professor X and
  Magneto, they were two young men discovering their powers for the first time.
  Before they were arch-enemies, they were closest of friends, working together
  with other mutants (some familiar, some new), to stop the greatest threat the
  world has ever known.
