  In celebration of the publisher's 75th anniversary, the hour-long special will

  to multi-media juggernaut. Hosted by Emily VanCamp (S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Sharon
  Carter), the documentary-style feature will include interviews with comic book
  icons, pop culture authorities, and Hollywood stars.  The special also
  promises an "extraordinary peek into Marvel's future!" Might Marvel release
  the first official footage from next year's Avengers: Age of Ultron or
  Ant-Man? If they do, you'll know about it here.
