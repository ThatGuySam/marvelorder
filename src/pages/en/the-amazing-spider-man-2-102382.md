  For Peter Parker, life is busy. Between taking out the bad guys as Spider-Man
  and spending time with the person he loves, Gwen Stacy, high school graduation
  cannot come quickly enough. Peter has not forgotten about the promise he made
  to Gwen’s father to protect her by staying away, but that is a promise he
  cannot keep. Things will change for Peter when a new villain, Electro,
  emerges, an old friend, Harry Osborn, returns, and Peter uncovers new clues
  about his past.
