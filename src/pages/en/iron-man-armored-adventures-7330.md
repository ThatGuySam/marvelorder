  Iron Man: Armored Adventures is a 3D CGI cartoon series based on the Marvel
  Comics superhero Iron Man. It debuted in the USA on the Nicktoons on April 24,
  2009, and has already begun airing on Canadian network Teletoon. Iron Man:
  Armored Adventures aired on Nickelodeon on July 4, 2009 until September 12,
  2009. The series is story edited by showrunner Christopher Yost, who also
  worked on Wolverine and the X-Men, and numerous other Marvel Animation
  projects. The television show is not related to the 2007 animated film The
  Invincible Iron Man; It has a different voice cast, but some story elements
  are similar and the show uses the same musical score as the film in some
  instances. It is the first Iron Man television series since Iron Man from
  1994–1996, and started airing after the success of the live action Iron Man
  film.


  The series follows the adventures of teenage child prodigy Tony Stark and his
  alter ego of Iron Man. As Iron Man, he uses his technological inventions to
  fight various similarly technologically advanced threats. His friends, James
  "Rhodey" Rhodes and Pepper Potts help him on his courageous, and dangerous
  adventures.
