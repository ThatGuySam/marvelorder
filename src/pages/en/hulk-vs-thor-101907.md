title: Hulk vs. Thor
slug: hulk-vs-thor
description: >-
  For ages, Odin has protected his kingdom of Asgard. But every winter, the
  All-Father must rest and regain his strength for one week. During this time,
  all of Asgard's foes (including trolls, giants, dark elves, and demons) try to
  claim the realm for their own, but they are always stopped by Odin's son, the
  mighty Thor, albeit with the loss of many brave Asgardian warriors. Loki, god
  of mischief, has kidnapped Dr. Bruce Banner and brought him to Asgard with the
  help of Amora, once Thor's lover, now the supervillain known as the
  Enchantress. Loki makes Banner angry and he changes into the Hulk. The
  Enchantress then casts a spell over the Hulk which separates Banner from his
  monstrous alter-ego and grants Loki control over the Hulk's body.
