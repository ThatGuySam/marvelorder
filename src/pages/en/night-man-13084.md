description: >-
  Night Man is an American action/adventure/sci-fi series that aired in
  syndication from September 15, 1997 to May 17, 1999. The series is loosely
  based on a comic book published by Malibu Comics and was created by Steve
  Englehart and developed for television by Glen A. Larson.


  It stars Matt McColm as the title character, a superhero whose real name was
  Johnny Domino, a saxophonist. Englehart would write three episodes of the
  series. Night Man is also one of the few series to cross over with characters
  from Larson's previous series: in the episode "Manimal", Johnny allies with
  Professor Jonathan Chase, the star of the short-lived 1980s' series Manimal.
