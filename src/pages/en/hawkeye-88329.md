description: >-
  Former Avenger Clint Barton has a seemingly simple mission: get back to his
  family for Christmas. Possible? Maybe with the help of Kate Bishop, a
  22-year-old archer with dreams of becoming a superhero. The two are forced to
  work together when a presence from Barton’s past threatens to derail far more
  than the festive spirit.
