description: >-
  King T'Challa returns home to the reclusive, technologically advanced African
  nation of Wakanda to serve as his country's new leader. However, T'Challa soon
  finds that he is challenged for the throne by factions within his own country
  as well as without. Using powers reserved to Wakandan kings, T'Challa assumes
  the Black Panther mantle to join with ex-girlfriend Nakia, the queen-mother,
  his princess-kid sister, members of the Dora Milaje (the Wakandan 'special
  forces') and an American secret agent, to prevent Wakanda from being dragged
  into a world war.
