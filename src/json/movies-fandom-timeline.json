She also remembers this as the earliest memory of when she gained her powers that allow her to shoot photon blasts out of her fists. Vers now trains with Yon-Rogg, aiming to become a member of Starforce. Although Yon-Rogg believes she is ready, the Supreme Intelligence, the artificial intelligence that rules the Kree Empire, figures otherwise but nonetheless allows Vers on the team, which consists of Minn-Erva, Korath, Bron-Char, and Att-Lass. Yon-Rogg gives the Starforce a briefing, to rescue a Kree operative named Soh-Larr. Yon-Rogg informs the team that Soh-Larr has been captured on the planet Torfa. Yon-Rogg instructs the team to perform an incursion on the planet, so Vers and the rest of the Starforce land underwater and used their suits to reach the surface. Soon they encountered Torfans who turned out to be Skrulls, getting ambushed by the Skrull leader Talos and his subordinates. Vers finds Soh-Larr, but realize he has been compromised by Talos, who kidnaps her to a Skrull spacecraft, while the rest of the Starforce retreat. On the spacecraft, Talos gains access to Vers' memories from various points in her life. Vers awakens just as Talos unlocks her memories, revealing that he wants information from her pertaining to a Light-Speed Engine. She orchestrates an escape, with Talos, Norex and two other Skrulls in pursuit, crash-landing to Planet C-53 or it's other name Earth.",

The interrogation is interrupted by one of the Skrulls. Vers give chase to the Skrull on a subway train, but the Skrull evades her and escapes amid a crowd at a train station. Fury and Coulson give chase to Vers, but Fury realizes that Coulson was actually abandoned at the shopping complex, and the Coulson sitting passenger-side next to him is a second Skrull impostor. The two have a scuffle, and the Skrull is killed when their car crashes into oncoming traffic. Vers utilizes a Skrull crystal containing her lost memories and begins recollecting them. She dresses in a civilian outfit she stole from a display and steals a motorcycle to drive to Pancho's Bar in the nearby town of Rosamond. Fury and Keller, who at this point has been compromised by Talos, take possession of the deceased Skrull and while performing an autopsy, Keller authorizes Fury to work with Vers, and eventually hand her in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. Fury finds Vers at the bar, and now fully convinced that the Skrulls are a threat, the two question each other to ensure that they are not Skrull impostors.",

She learns that she was a fighter pilot for the United States Air Force alongside a fellow comrade, Maria Rambeau, both under the tutelage of Wendy Lawson for Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S.. Vers recognizes Lawson as the woman murdered in her dreams and later learns from Yon-Rogg that she was a Kree named Mar-Vell. Fury reports to Keller of their location and a posse of agents led by Keller arrive, including Coulson. Upon realizing that Keller had been compromised by Talos the whole time, Fury goes rogue with Vers. Coulson allows the two to escape. Motivated to seek answers from Rambeau, Fury, and Vers, accompanied by Goose, a cat who they encountered at the facility, hijack a Quinjet to the Rambeau Residence in New Orleans, Louisiana. Both Rambeau and her daughter Monica are surprised to see Vers still alive. The two identify Vers as Carol Danvers, a fighter pilot who was seemingly killed with Lawson in a test flight gone awry. They also identify Goose as Lawson and Danvers' pet. Talos and Norex arrive at the Rambeau Residence, only to negotiate a temporary alliance after Talos reveals that he was in possession of a black box from the plane crash. Talos reveals that Danvers has been deceived by the Kree and that the Skrulls are simply homeless refugees constantly on the run from the Kree, on the brink of extinction. Upon hearing the recording from the black box, Danvers finally recollects the memory of what happened. The assassination was orchestrated by none other than Yon-Rogg, who had uncovered Mar-Vell's deception. Mar-Vell instructed Danvers to destroy the energy core powering the light-speed engine, but in an attempt to destroy it, Danvers gained cosmic powers after absorbing the energy from the exploding engine. With no recollection of her memories, Yon-Rogg was authorized by the Supreme Intelligence to train her into becoming a Kree soldier.",

The next day, Yon-Rogg arrives on Earth to confront Danvers. He quickly realizes that the Danvers he was communicating with was Norex, and swiftly executes him upon learning of the laboratory orbiting Earth, and learning that the source of the energy core is the Tesseract. Danvers, Fury, Talos, Maria, and Goose take the Quinjet to the laboratory, and Talos is reunited with his wife and daughter. Danvers finds the Tesseract, but the Starforce ambush them and place Danvers under stasis to confront the Supreme Intelligence. In a final conversation with the Supreme Intelligence, Danvers removes the inhibitor that has been limiting her full power potential and engages in an all-out battle with the Starforce. Fury realizes that Goose is actually a Flerken, and witnesses his abilities firsthand after she swallows the Tesseract and several Kree soldiers echoing an earlier scene where Talos expressed fear of Flerkens and insisted that Goose was not a cat. In a battle for the Tesseract, Danvers overpowers Korath, Bron-Char and Att-Lass while the Skrulls escape on the Quadjet with Rambeau and Fury. In the process, Talos is shot by Yon-Rogg, rendering him inoperable to fight.",

Ego reveals his master plan to Peter, he traveled the universe and planted seedlings on thousands of worlds that would terraform them into new extensions of Ego, but he needed a second Celestial’s power to activate the seedlings, so he conceived children with hundreds of women all across the galaxy and hired Yondu to collect them. Every other child was killed when they proved unable to access Celestial power, but Peter can harness the power, and Ego uses him to activate all the seedlings, which begin their terraforming that will eventually consume every world and every person. Peter is hypnotized by Ego’s power until Ego reveals he deliberately caused the death of Meredith Quill's mother, prompting Peter to fight back. ",

Scott with no other choice went \"Subatomic\", shrinking down small enough to pass through the atomic structure of the Yellowjacket suit destroying it. Darren could only scream as he shrink into nothingness. Scott was than trapped in the Quantum Realm, but managed to escape it by rewiring the suit's regulator with a enlarging Pym Discs, when he heard Cassie's voice.

Ross explains that, due to the events in Lagos, the United Nations has decided they can no longer be allowed to operate privately. To that end, it has been decided that the Avengers will sign the \"Sokovia Accords\", which will establish an international governing body to control the Avengers' movements as well as monitor and police the rapidly growing number of superhumans. The team is divided over the act. Tony supports government oversight because he feels guilty for his role in creating Ultron, whereas Steve worries that the Avengers may be compromised if it comes under the control of a third party after the infiltration of S.H.I.E.L.D. by HYDRA. Ross states that refusing to sign the accords will be seen as an act of resignation. Elsewhere retired HYDRA general Vasily Karpov is ambushed by Helmut Zemo, who asks for information regarding the 1991 mission. Karpov refuses, forcing Zemo to kill him. During their debate about the Accords, Steve learns that Peggy Carter has passed away in her sleep and leaves for her funeral in London. While there, he learns Sharon Carter was Peggy's niece as she delivers a eulogy about how one should never back down from what they believe in. This solidifies Roger's resolve not to sign the accords. Wanda finds herself confined to the New Avengers Facility by Vision, ostensibly for her safety since feelings are running high after what happened in Lagos. ",

The Ancient One tells Strange that he too will have to break the rules, to balance out Mordo's steadfast nature, before dying despite the best efforts of Strange and a bewildered Palmer. Strange and Mordo arrive in Hong Kong to find Wong dead and the Sanctum destroyed, with the Dark Dimension already engulfing Earth. Strange uses the Eye to turn back time and save Wong, before creating an infinite time loop inside the Dark Dimension that traps himself and Dormammu in the same moment forever. After killing Strange many times to no avail, Dormammu reluctantly agrees to leave Earth if Strange breaks the loop, taking Kaecilius and his zealots with him. ",

The scavengers proceed to beat Thor until a drunk woman appears from her ship, claiming Thor to be \"hers\".

However, due to the unusual relativistic effects of how they got there, Loki has been there for weeks, earning the Grandmaster's favour. The Grandmaster pays the woman for Thor and tells him that he can have his freedom if he defeats the arena's champion. Thor is thrown in to the gladiator's quarters where he meets Korg, an exiled Kronan resistance fighter, and his friend Miek. Korg states that no one has ever escaped or beaten this champion.

Steve contemplates outside of the building about what to do next. Tony, having a change of heart, shows up then to extend his help and asks if the \"whole team\" are getting back together. Steve tell him they're still working on gathering everyone who's available together. Tony tells Steve that he's agreeing to help on the condition that trying to reverse what Thanos did won't reset what has happened since, as he doesn't want to lose his daughter.

With the test proven a success, the Avengers proceed with the next phase of preparation which is to determine the location of each Infinity Stone in the past. While the team discusses strategy, Rhodes argues the suggestion of travelling back in time to kill 'Baby Thanos' to which Bruce explains that altering events in the past will not alter the present but will instead create an alternate universe leaving the only feasible course of action of acquiring the Infinity Stones to restore everyone in the present time. This presents a challenge as they possess a scarce supply of Pym Particles to operate with and no means of replenishing them without Hank Pym their creator, effectively limiting their travel to a few trips. The team discuss their past encounters with the Infinity Stones, they manage to recall the placement of each Infinity Stone in time. Fortunately, they realize the Time, Space, and Mind Stone were all present in 2012 New York City, in relatively close proximity with each other, following the Battle of New York. However, the other three Stones were only accessible to them in entirely different places and times, with the Reality Stone being present on Asgard in 2013, and the Soul and Power Stones being present in 2014 on Vormir and Morag respectively. Though their supply of Pym Particles allows for one round-trip each, with their targets located, the Avengers split into three separate teams; Thor and Rocket to Asgard, Nebula Rhodes to Morag, Natasha and Clint to Vormir and Steve, Tony, Bruce, and Lang to New York.

Thor insists upon being the one to wield it, claiming to be the strongest, but the others argue that using the gauntlet at full power channels more power than he's capable of safely handling; being reminded how Thanos barely survived using it. Ultimately, it's Bruce, who theorizes that his unique physiology should enable him to safely use the device, being that the majority of the energy being harnessed is gamma radiation. Banner puts the gauntlet on and it causes him intense pain as the energy from the stones surges through him, but eventually, he manages to snap his fingers. Bruce suffers major damage to his right arm and shoulder but believes he was successful in restoring the universe's population. This is proven true when Laura calls Clint on the phone. ",

However, with the Avengers Quantum Tunnel being destroyed along with the Avengers' facility, their alternative is to use the one housed in Luis' van, which is behind enemy lines. The Avengers' forces manage to gain the upper hand, and even restrain Thanos, momentarily until he orders the Sanctuary II to fire upon the battlefield. As artillery fire rains down on both forces, Captain Marvel finally arrives, destroying the Sanctuary II, and pushes back the enemy forces. The Avengers continue to trade possession of the Nano Gauntlet among each other, all the while evading Thanos as they proceed towards the van. Just within reach of their goal, Thanos destroys the Quantum Tunnel device and secures the gauntlet for himself. Strange reminds Stark of their earlier discussion as the Avengers swarm Thanos, who's attempting to activate the Infinity Stones. With the last Avenger defeated, Tony leaps at Thanos and tussles with him before being thrown off. Thanos revels in his supposed victory before snapping his fingers, but nothing happens. Thanos realizes the Infinity Stones are missing, as his attention turns to Tony who is now in possession of the stones in his nanoparticles armor constructing a gauntlet with them. Tony retorts Thanos previous statement, declaring \"i am Iron Man\" before snapping his fingers. Thanos witnesses his entire army turn to dust, and accepts defeat before he himself finally crumbles in the wind. Tony collapses from the wounds he sustained from using the Infinity Stones. After sharing brief and silent goodbyes with Rhodes and Peter, he is comforted by Pepper who assures him she and Morgan will be all right. With this, Tony died, holding her hand as his armor's arc reactor went dead. ",

Peter attempts to stop it to no avail, until the armored Beck arrives, and destroys it after luring it out of the canal. That night, Fury meets Parker in person and introduces him to Beck. Beck explains that the creatures are Elementals from an alternate dimension of Earth, which have emerged to their dimension in the Blip. Beck is determined to defeat them because they killed his family, and reveals that the final Elemental, Fire, is due to make an appearance in Prague. To accommodate Peter's request to keep his identity as Spider-Man a secret without arousing suspicion, Fury rearranges the school trip's location from Paris to Prague, through the trip's chaperones, Roger Harrington and Julius Dell.

The only bone of contention for Scott is that his Cassie, who is now living with him and Hope, has been arrested more than once due to her participation in protests. After Scott and Hope bail her out, the two have a mild argument where she accuses her father of enjoying his fame and not actually doing anything to help the world now it isn't under an immediate threat. She also accidentally implies during the conversation that she has her own super suit, although quickly tries to shrug it off when her father enquires further. They head to the Pym Residence to have dinner, and the conversation turns to a device that Cassie and Hank have been working on; a Quantum Satellite. They explain it's designed to try and send a signal into the Quantum Realm to try and establish communications. Janet freaks out when she realises that someone could send a signal back and demands it be shut down, however the device ends up imploding and sucking in the five, along with some ants that Hank had been experimenting on to increase their intelligent. The Pym family are separated from Scott and Cassie and land in a completely different part of the Quantum Realm to the two. ",

As Ant-Man, Scott shrinks into the enlarged, blown up Multiversal Power Core, shrinking it with the Wasp's help.
